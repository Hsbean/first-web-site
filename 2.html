    <h2>CSS </h2>
<p><br><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
<br>(including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
<br>[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]

<br>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility
, <br>since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
<br>enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
<br>css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
